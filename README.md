# Rani-Of-Jhansi-Themed-Game

This is a Java based Game developed on Processing.ide. This game is created to pay tribute to Rani Lakshmi Bai.
It highlights mainly three phases 
1. Rani Lakhmi Bai's rebel nature towards  Britishers and their Doctrine of Lapse
2. Avoiding all the gender biased and patriarchy talks from men
3. Uplifting women for Women empowerment and fighting against men, and recruiting them for Durga Dal


In this Game, the main character is Rani Lakshmi Bai, and she needs to collect members for her Durga Dal.
Durga Dal refers to a small group of women, who took part in military and strategic operations and
were under direct control of Rani Lakshmi Bai.

This game depicts the patriarchy during that period and sterotypes also. Like Rani Lakshmi Bai, avoids all the norms and rises above them, similar she dodges these obstacles in the Game.

In this game, we depict Rani's rebel nature towards British and their Doctrine of Lapse, by attacking on them as enemies.

This Game was implemented with a makey-makey kit as controller. This game was built as a part of PIS endsem Project

In this project I have utlised various gaming concepts and geometry. Understand the use of sprites and created jumping animations and sound effects.
